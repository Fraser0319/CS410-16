How to install Agda on a departmental machine (we hope)
=======================================================

A similar procedure may work on any machine which already has a
sufficiently recent version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
installed on it: https://www.haskell.org/

1. Ensure that your machine is running Linux.

2. In a terminal window, issue the following commands:

  cabal update
                         # ensures Haskell's package manager
			 # is up to date

  cabal install alex
                         # installs Haskell's lexer-generator

  cabal install happy
                         # installs Haskell's parser-generator

  cabal install agda
                         # installs Agda herself

  agda-mode setup
                         # configures emacs to work with Agda

3. Start emacs, loading an Agda file, e.g., cd to the repo and

  emacs Hello.agda

4. Explore!

(Stuart has helpfully written an emacs and Agda cheat-sheet.txt file
which you can find in the repo.)
